        "   (2) It shall come into force on such date as the Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, appoint, and different dates may be appointed for different provisions of this Sanhita.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Section 2: Applicability\n",
        "(3) Every person shall be liable to punishment under this Sanhita and not otherwise for every act or omission contrary to the provisions thereof, of which he shall be guilty within India.\n",
        "\n",
        "(4) Any person liable, by any law for the time being in force in India, to be tried for an offence committed beyond India shall be dealt with according to the provisions of this Sanhita for any act committed beyond India in the same manner as if such act had been committed within India.\n",
        "\n",
        "(5) The provisions of this Sanhita shall also apply to any offence committed by:\n",
        "   - (a) any citizen of India in any place without and beyond India;\n",
        "   - (b) any person on any ship or aircraft registered in India wherever it may be;\n",
        "   - (c) any person in any place without and beyond India committing offence targeting a computer resource located in India.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Explanation**:\n",
        "In this section, the word “offence” includes every act committed outside India which, if committed in India, would be punishable under this Sanhita.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Illustration**:\n",
        "A, who is a citizen of India, commits a murder in any place without and beyond India. He can be tried and convicted of murder in any place in India in which he may be found.\n",

        "### Section 3: Special Provisions\n",
        "(6) Nothing in this Sanhita shall affect the provisions of any Act for punishing mutiny and desertion of officers, soldiers, sailors, or airmen in the service of the Government of India or the provisions of any special or local law.\n",

        "- **(3) Child**: Means any person below the age of eighteen years.\n",
        "- **(4) Counterfeit**:\n",
        "  A person is said to “counterfeit” who causes one thing to resemble another thing, intending by means of that resemblance to practice deception, or knowing it to be likely that deception will thereby be practiced.\n",
        "  - **Explanation 1**: It is not essential to counterfeiting that the imitation should be exact.\n",
        "  - **Explanation 2**: When a person causes one thing to resemble another thing, and the resemblance is such that a person might be deceived thereby, it shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, that the person so causing the one thing to resemble the other thing intended by means of that resemblance to practice deception or knew it to be likely that deception would thereby be practiced.\n",
